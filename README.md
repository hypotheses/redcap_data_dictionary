### ICBS Comprehensive Tumor Bank
The information in the current registry is divided into the following six forms compatible with [Genomics Data Common](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Dictionary/). Whenever possible, we use the same "Property" name and "Values" as implemented by GDC. Common Data Element (CDE) for each variable is available for viewing from the GDC website.
